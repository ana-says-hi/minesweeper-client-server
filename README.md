# Mines

A well known game, now with a simple design

The client sendsthe coordinates of a tile to the server.
The server checks in the mine matrix if the coodinates given by the client contain a mine.
If a mine is found, the game is over.
If a mine is not found, the client can send another pair of coordinates.

The mine matrix is randomly generated.
An uncovered filed, if it does not contain a mine, will display the number of mines in the close vecinity.
